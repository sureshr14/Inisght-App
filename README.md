## Bet Goals

Bet Goals is an app I created during my time as an Insight fellow to use soccer and betting related data to predict the result of matches in the English Premier League and identify which games to bet on. The English Premier League is watched by an audience of 1.35 billion people every year and around a billion pounds are bet on games every year. In this project we identify and exploit systemic inefficiencies in the betting odds.
